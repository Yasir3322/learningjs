        <p>The blue jay is a passerine bird in the family Corvidae, native to eastern North America.
             It lives in most of the eastern and central United States; some eastern populations may 
             be migratory. Resident populations are also in Newfoundland, Canada; breeding populations
              are found across southern Canada.</p>
